## Circuit

Voltage Divider Circuit

Gnd &mdash; 4.7kOhm &mdash; A0 &mdash; LDR &mdash; 3V

## Exercise

Open and upload [basic_analog_read](../basic_analog_read) to the Arduino. This sketch reads the LDR connected to pin A0 and reports the level at A0 of the voltage divider circuit outlined above.

Try covering the LDR&mdash;what do you observe?

Try putting a light source close to the LDR&mdash;what do you observe?

Things to consider:
- How does the value of the resistor in the voltage divider circuit change values / way the sensor works?
- Is the LDR omnidirectional or is it biased to a certain direction? 
- How would you physically change the way that it picks up light?
