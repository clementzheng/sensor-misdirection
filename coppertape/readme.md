# Copper Tape

### Copper on a tape! This sticky material is ideal for creating conductive traces on other materials and things!

## Exercise

Make a switch with some material and copper tape. Use [basic_digital_read_pullup](../basic_digital_read_pullup) to read your switch.

Things to consider:
- Adding resistance to a copper tape circuit by soldering resistors between copper tape traces? Then using `analogRead` to read different segments of copper tape separated by resistors?
