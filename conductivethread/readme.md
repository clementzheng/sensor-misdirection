# Conductive Thread

### More ideas and inspiration check out [Kobakant](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/).



Think about what you know about using thread, e.g. sewing, knitting, crochet, knots etc., 
<br>and then think about what you about using electrical wires. 

Now, think about what you can do with thread that is conductive!

## Exercise

Make a switch with fabrics and conductive thread. Use [basic_digital_read_pullup](../basic_digital_read_pullup) to read your switch.

Things to consider:
- what is the resistance of the thread over its length?
- Use `analogRead` to detect the change in resistance of a long length of conductive thread? [hint](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=1781)
